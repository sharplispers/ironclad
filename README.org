Ironclad is a cryptography library written entirely in Common Lisp. It
includes support for several popular [[#ciphers][ciphers]], [[#digests][digests]], [[#message-authentication-codes][MACs]] and
[[#public-key-cryptography][public key cryptography]] algorithms. For several implementations that
support Gray streams, support is included for convenient [[#gray-streams][stream wrappers]].

Most of the algorithms were written with efficiency for specific
Common Lisp implementations in mind, although portable code is
provided as an alternative in nearly all instances. The framework
should be flexible enough to accommodate implementation-specific
optimizations when possible.

Test vectors for many of the algorithms are included to provide
a level of confidence in the correctness of the implementations.

* Warnings
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: warning
  :END:

*Ironclad should not be considered safe against side channel attacks.*

Some algorithms can be safe against side channel attacks on some
architectures using some Common Lisp implementations, but in the
general case it can't be guaranteed. This is due to the fact that
integers and arithmetic functions of Common Lisp implementations are
usually not safe against side channel attacks.


*Ironclad's digest, MAC and cipher objects should not be considered thread
safe.*

Creating a digest, a MAC or a cipher object and using it in several threads at
the same time can lead to an undefined result. If you need to do that, you must
put locks in your application where necessary.


*Ironclad's pseudo random number generation should only be considered thread
safe with bordeaux-threads.*

If you have a multi-threaded application in which you want to use functions
requiring some random numbers (key derivation, key generation, public key
encryption, signature, etc.) in several threads, each of these threads must have
its own PRNG, or they might generate the same "random" numbers. If the threads
are created using the *bordeaux-threads* library (or by a library using
*bordeaux-threads*, like *lparallel*), this is done automatically. However, if
you are using the threading functions of your Common Lisp implementation
directly, you have to bind the ~*prng*~ special variable to a new PRNG in each
thread. There is an example showing how it can be done in the section about
[[make-prng][make-prng]].

* Installation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: installation
  :END:

The current version of Ironclad is 0.47. It can be downloaded
at [[https://github.com/sharplispers/ironclad/archive/v0.47.tar.gz]].
If you are feeling adventurous, you can download a bleeding-edge version
at [[https://github.com/sharplispers/ironclad]].

It comes with an ASDF system definition, so ~(asdf:load-system "ironclad")~
should be all that you need to get started. The testsuite can be run
by substituting ~asdf:test-system~ for ~asdf:load-system~ in the form above.

If you are using [[https://www.quicklisp.org][Quicklisp]] to manage your libraries, just use
~(ql:quickload "ironclad")~.

When Ironclad is loaded, its functions are in the ~ironclad~ package (e.g.
~(ironclad:make-cipher ...)~). If you prefer, you can also use the ~crypto~
nickname (e.g. ~(crypto:make-cipher ...)~).

Ironclad has been tested in the following implementations:
 - SBCL x86/linux, x86-64/linux (primary development platforms)
 - SBCL x86-64/solaris, x86/darwin
 - CMUCL x86/linux
 - ABCL with Sun's 1.5.0 JVM
 - Lispworks 5.0.1 x86/linux
 - Lispworks 5.1.2 x86-64/darwin x86/windows
 - Allegro 8.0 x86/linux
 - Allegro 8.1 x86/linux, x86-64/linux, sparc/solaris
 - CLISP 2.41 x86/linux, x86/cygwin
 - Clozure Common Lisp 1.11 x86-64/Linux
 - Clozure Common Lisp 1.10 x86-64/darwin
 - ECL 16.1.3 x86-64/linux

All included tests should pass successfully. If you use a platform not
listed above, please send your platform information so that it can be
added to the above list. If the tests do not all pass, you have found
a bug; please report it.

By default, Ironclad uses some implementation dependent low-level code to make
some functions run much faster (currently, some assembly for SBCL and CCL, some
C code for ECL). If for some reason you want to disable these optimisations and
use the generic Lisp code, it can be achieved by commenting out the
~(pushnew :ironclad-assembly *features*)~ line in the /src/package.lisp/ file.

* License
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: license

Ironclad is released under a MIT-like license; you can do pretty much
anything you want to with the code except claim that you wrote it.

#+NAME: make-cipher
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-cipher name &key key mode initialization-vector padding tweak) => cipher
#+END_SRC

Return a cipher object suitable for use for both encryption and decryption.

/name/ denotes the encryption algorithm to use. [[list-all-ciphers][list-all-ciphers]] will tell you
the names of all supported ciphers. They are:
 - 3des
 - aes
 - arcfour (rc4)
 - aria
 - blowfish
 - camellia
 - cast5
 - chacha
 - chacha/12
 - chacha/8
 - des
 - idea
 - kalyna128
 - kalyna256
 - kalyna512
 - kuznyechik
 - misty1
 - rc2
 - rc5
 - rc6
 - salsa20
 - salsa20/12
 - salsa20/8
 - seed
 - serpent
 - sm4
 - sosemanuk
 - square
 - tea
 - threefish1024
 - threefish256
 - threefish512
 - twofish
 - xchacha
 - xchacha/12
 - xchacha/8
 - xor (not a real cipher, use only for testing)
 - xsalsa20
 - xsalsa20/12
 - xsalsa20/8
 - xtea

/name/ can be a symbol in the ~keyword~ package or in the ~ironclad~ package;
~:aes~ for AES, ~ironclad:arcfour~ for RC4, and so forth.

/mode/ describes the mode of operation for the cipher. Stream ciphers
such as Arcfour can operate in only one mode, ~stream~. Block ciphers
such as AES and DES can operate in several different modes:
 - ecb
 - cbc
 - ofb
 - cfb (note that Ironclad's CFB mode is /n/-bit CFB, where /n/ is the [[block-length][block-length]] of the cipher)
 - cfb8 (this seems to be the mode other crypto packages call CFB)
 - ctr

/mode/ should be a symbol in the ~keyword~ or ~ironclad~ packages;
~:stream~, ~ironclad:ofb~, and so forth. An error will be signaled if
/mode/ is not appropriate for the cipher /name/.

/initialization-vector/ (IV) should be supplied only if /mode/ requires one.
/initialization-vector/ should be a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~.
The supplied IV should be the same length as the [[block-length][block-length]] of /name/.
The Chacha and Salsa20 stream ciphers also use an initialization
vector (nonce). It should be 8 bytes long for Chacha and Salsa20, and
24 bytes long for XChacha and XSalsa20.

/key/ is, of course, the key for the cipher.
/key/ should be a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~.

If /padding/ is supplied, the specified padding method will be used by [[encrypt][encrypt]]
and [[decrypt][decrypt]] to handle short blocks when the ~:handle-final-block~ argument is
supplied. /padding/ will only be used if the mode is ECB or CBC. The possible
values for /padding/ are ~:pkcs7~, ~:ansi-x923~ and ~:iso-7816-4~.

If the cipher can use a tweak (e.g. threefish), it can be specified
with the /tweak/ key parameter.


#+NAME: encrypt
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(encrypt cipher plaintext ciphertext &key plaintext-start plaintext-end ciphertext-start handle-final-block) => n-bytes-consumed, n-bytes-produced
#+END_SRC

Encrypts data according to /cipher/ from /plaintext/ starting at
/plaintext-start/ and continuing until /plaintext-end/. The encrypted
data is placed in /ciphertext/ starting at /ciphertext-start/.


#+NAME: decrypt
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(decrypt cipher ciphertext plaintext &key ciphertext-start ciphertext-end plaintext-start handle-final-block) => n-bytes-consumed, n-bytes-produced
#+END_SRC

Decrypts data according to /cipher/ from /ciphertext/ starting at
/ciphertext-start/ and continuing until /ciphertext-end/. The decrypted
data is placed in /plaintext/ starting at /plaintext-start/.


#+NAME: encrypt-in-place
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(encrypt-in-place cipher text &key start end) => n-bytes-consumed, n-bytes-produced
#+END_SRC
#+NAME: decrypt-in-place
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(decrypt-in-place cipher text &key start end) => n-bytes-consumed, n-bytes-produced
#+END_SRC

Encrypts or decrypts data in /text/ between /start/ and /end/ "in-place"
according to /cipher/. These functions are shorthand for:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(encrypt cipher text text :plaintext-start start :plaintext-end end :ciphertext-start start)
(decrypt cipher text text :ciphertext-start start :ciphertext-end end :plaintext-start start)
#+END_EXAMPLE

_Note:_ [[encrypt-in-place][encrypt-in-place]] and [[decrypt-in-place][decrypt-in-place]] do not support
a /handle-final-block/ parameter as [[encrypt][encrypt]] and [[decrypt][decrypt]] do. If you
need the functionality that /handle-final-block/ provides, then you
need to use [[encrypt][encrypt]] and [[decrypt][decrypt]].

_Note:_ /n-bytes-consumed/ and /n-bytes-produced/ may not always be
equal to the length of the data specified in the call to
[[encrypt-in-place][encrypt-in-place]] or [[decrypt-in-place][decrypt-in-place]]. This subtlely is also present in
[[encrypt][encrypt]] or [[decrypt][decrypt]].


#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(encrypt-message cipher message &key start end &allow-other-keys) => encrypted-message
#+END_SRC

Return the /message/ between /start/ and /end/ encrypted with the /cipher/; the
class of /cipher/ determines the algorithm used to encrypt the message.


#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(decrypt-message cipher message &key start end &allow-other-keys) => decrypted-message
#+END_SRC

Return the /message/ between /start/ and /end/ decrypted by the /cipher/; the
class of /cipher/ determines the algorithm used to decrypt the message.

** Inquiry functions

#+NAME: list-all-ciphers
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(list-all-ciphers) => list
#+END_SRC

Returns a list of cipher-names that may be validly passed to [[make-cipher][make-cipher]].


#+NAME: cipher-supported-p
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(cipher-supported-p name) => boolean
#+END_SRC

Returns ~t~ if /name/ would be in the list returned by [[list-all-ciphers][list-all-ciphers]],
~nil~ otherwise.


#+NAME: key-lengths
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(key-lengths cipher) => list
#+END_SRC

Return a list of valid key lengths for /cipher/.


#+NAME: block-length
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(block-length cipher) => number
#+END_SRC

Return the number of octets /cipher/ processes at a time. This
function always returns 1 for stream ciphers.

** Key stream position

Block ciphers in CTR mode and some stream ciphers have the ability to change the
current position within the key stream in constant time instead of having to
consume all the bytes until the desired position is reached.

#+NAME: keystream-position
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(keystream-position cipher &optional position) => number or boolean
#+END_SRC

Return or change the current /position/ within the key stream of a /cipher/.
When /position/ is not supplied, [[keystream-position][keystream-position]] returns the current position
in the key stream, or /nil/ if it can't be determined. When /position/ is
supplied, the key stream position of the /cipher/ is set to that /position/ if
possible. [[keystream-position][keystream-position]] returns /t/ if the repositioning is performed
successfully, or /nil/ otherwise.

[[keystream-position][keystream-position]] can be used with the following ciphers:
 - all the block ciphers (aes, twofish, etc.) in CTR mode
 - chacha
 - chacha/12
 - chacha/8
 - salsa20
 - salsa20/12
 - salsa20/8
 - xchacha
 - xchacha/12
 - xchacha/8
 - xsalsa20
 - xsalsa20/12
 - xsalsa20/8

* Digests
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: digests
  :END:

Digest functions, also known as hash functions, produce fixed-length
output (a /digest/ or /hash/) from a variable-length message. The
simplest example of a digest function is one that adds up all the
bytes in the message modulo 256. This digest function fails one test
of a cryptographically secure hash function: it must be difficult to
find a message with a given digest. It also fails the other test: it
must be difficult to find two messages with the same digest.

Ironclad provides several cryptographically secure digest functions
and several non-cryptographically secure digest functions.

_Note:_ In the functions below, messages or parts thereof are provided
as octet vectors; Ironclad has no facilities for producing digests of
strings. If you need to obtain the digest of a string, then you need
to figure out how to convert it to an octet vector first. This is
a deliberate design decision. Characters are not equivalent to bytes.
See your local Unicode guru for more details.


#+NAME: make-digest
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-digest digest-name &rest keys &key &allow-other-keys) => digester
#+END_SRC

Returns a digest object. /digest-name/ is a keyword naming the
algorithm you wish /digester/ to use. The supported digest names can be found
by calling [[list-all-digests][list-all-digests]]. They are:
 - adler32
 - blake2
 - blake2/160
 - blake2/256
 - blake2/384
 - blake2s
 - blake2s/128
 - blake2s/160
 - blake2s/224
 - crc24
 - crc32
 - groestl
 - groestl/224
 - groestl/256
 - groestl/384
 - jh
 - jh/224
 - jh/256
 - jh/384
 - keccak
 - keccak/224
 - keccak/256
 - keccak/384
 - kupyna
 - kupyna/256
 - md2
 - md4
 - md5
 - ripemd-128
 - ripemd-160
 - sha1
 - sha224
 - sha256
 - sha3
 - sha3/224
 - sha3/256
 - sha3/384
 - sha384
 - sha512
 - shake128
 - shake256
 - skein1024
 - skein1024/384
 - skein1024/512
 - skein256
 - skein256/128
 - skein256/160
 - skein256/224
 - skein512
 - skein512/128
 - skein512/160
 - skein512/224
 - skein512/256
 - skein512/384
 - sm3
 - streebog
 - streebog/256
 - tiger
 - tree-hash
 - whirlpool

Like for [[make-cipher][make-cipher]], /digest-name/ should be a symbol in the
~keyword~ or ~ironclad~ packages.

Some algorithms (e.g. shake128 and shake256) can produce digests of
any size. The size of the digest in bytes can be specified with the
/output-length/ key parameter:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(make-digest :shake256 :output-length 123)
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+NAME: update-digest
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(update-digest digester thing &key &allow-other-keys) => (values)
#+END_SRC

Updates the internal state of /digester/ with the contents of /thing/.
The exact method is determined by the type of /thing/.

There are several methods defined on this generic function that take
a particular digester and a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~ as
well as the usual /start/ and /end/ keyword arguments. These methods
update the state of /digester/ with the subsequence of the array
denoted by /start/ and /end/. They are not listed here because there's
one method for every type of digest that Ironclad provides, and
listing them would get very tedious for no benefit. An example should
suffice.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(let ((digester (ironclad:make-digest :sha1))
      (array (make-array 16 :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8) :initial-element 0)))
  ;; Update with 16 zeroes.
  (ironclad:update-digest digester array)
  ;; Update with 8 ones.
  (fill array 1 :start 2 :end 10)
  (ironclad:update-digest digester array :start 2 :end 10))
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(update-digest digester (stream stream) &key buffer start end &allow-other-keys) => digester
#+END_SRC

Update the internal state of /digester/ with the contents of /stream/,
which must respond to ~read-byte~ or ~read-sequence~ with
a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~ and return /digester/. It
differs from [[digest-stream][digest-stream]], below, in that you may need to digest data
before or after the contents of /stream/ (this happens, for instance,
when signing the contents of some file).


#+NAME: produce-digest
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(produce-digest digester &key digest digest-start) => digest
#+END_SRC

Return the digest of the data processed by /digester/ so far.

If /digest/ is provided, the computed digest will be placed into
/digest/ starting at /digest-start/. /digest/ must be a
~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~. An [[insufficient-buffer-space][insufficient-buffer-space]]
error will be signaled if there is insufficient space in /digest/.

** High-level convenience functions

Several high-level convenience functions that encapsulate common
sequences of [[make-digest][make-digest]], [[update-digest][update-digest]] and [[produce-digest][produce-digest]] are
provided by Ironclad as well. They come in two flavors: the first
takes a digest name as would be provided to [[make-digest][make-digest]]. The second
way to call these functions is to provide an actual digest object as
the first argument. So one can say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(ironclad:digest-sequence :md5 *buffer*)
#+END_EXAMPLE

or, equivalently:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(let ((digester (ironclad:make-digest :md5)))
  (ironclad:digest-sequence digester *buffer*))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The second form comes in handy if you plan on [[*Miscellaneous][reusing the digest object]].


#+NAME: digest-sequence
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(digest-sequence digest-spec sequence &rest args &key start end digest digest-start) => digest
#+END_SRC

Returns the digest of the subsequence of /sequence/ bounded by /start/
and /end/, according to /digest-name/. /sequence/ must be
a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~. /digest/ and /digest-start/
are as in [[produce-digest][produce-digest]].


#+NAME: digest-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(digest-stream digest-spec stream &rest args &key buffer start end digest digest-start) => digest
#+END_SRC

Returns the digest of the contents of the stream specified by
/stream/. ~read-byte~ must be a legal operation on /stream/ and return
an ~(unsigned-byte 8)~. In a similar fashion, ~read-sequence~ on
/stream/ must support reading into a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~.
/digest/ and /digest-start/ are as in [[produce-digest][produce-digest]].

If /buffer/ is provided, it must be a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~;
the portion of /buffer/ between /start/ and /end/ will be used to read
the data from the stream.


#+NAME: digest-file
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(digest-file digest-spec pathname &rest args &key buffer start end digest digest-start) => digest
#+END_SRC

Returns the digest of the contents of the file named by /pathname/.
/digest/ and /digest-start/ are as in [[produce-digest][produce-digest]].

If /buffer/ is provided, it must be a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~;
the portion of /buffer/ between /start/ and /end/ will be used to read
the data from the stream.

** Inquiry functions

#+NAME: list-all-digests
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(list-all-digests) => list
#+END_SRC

Returns a list whose elements may be validly passed to [[make-digest][make-digest]].


#+NAME: digest-supported-p
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(digest-supported-p name) => boolean
#+END_SRC

Returns ~t~ if /name/ would be in the list returned by [[list-all-digests][list-all-digests]],
~nil~ otherwise.


#+NAME: digest-length
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(digest-length digest) => number
#+END_SRC

Returns the length of the digest computed by /digest/, which may be
a digest-name or a digest instance.

** Miscellaneous

Ironclad digests are CLOS objects; the interesting thing about this
for most purposes is that functions like ~reinitialize-instance~ are
supported. This means one can write a fairly efficient clone of the
=md5sum= program like so:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(defun digest-sum-files (digest-name &rest files)
  (unless files
    (error "no files given to digest"))
  (loop with buffer = (make-array 8192 :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))
        with digest = (make-array (ironclad:digest-length digest-name)
                                  :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))
       for file in files
       for digester = (ironclad:make-digest digest-name)
       then (reinitialize-instance digester)
       do (ironclad:digest-file digester file :buffer buffer :digest digest)
          (format t "~A ~A~%" (file-namestring file)
                  (ironclad:byte-array-to-hex-string digest))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Tree hashes

Ironclad supports tree hashes, as described in [[http://web.archive.org/web/20080316033726/http://www.open-content.net/specs/draft-jchapweske-thex-02.html][Tree Hash EXchange format]].
You create tree hashes as if you were creating a digest:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(ironclad:make-digest :tree-hash)
#+END_EXAMPLE

By default, this creates a tree hash that uses the Tiger digest
algorithm internally and a segment size of 1024. Since using the Tiger
digest algorithm is so common, a convenience function that makes your
intent obvious has also been provided:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(ironclad:make-tiger-tree-hash)
#+END_EXAMPLE

You may indicate that you wish to use a different algorithm than
Tiger:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(ironclad:make-digest '(:treehash :digest :sha256))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or you might wish to use a different segment size:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(ironclad:make-digest '(:tree-hash :block-length 16384))
#+END_EXAMPLE

There is currently no interface for obtaining the intermediate hashes
computed while computing the final tree hash.

* Message authentication codes
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: message-authentication-codes
  :END:      

A message authentication code is a cryptographic function of some data
and a user-specified key. Only a person knowing the key can recompute
the MAC for the given message. A MAC is useful where maintaining data
integrity is required, but the secrecy of the data is not paramount.

Ironclad provides different kinds of MACs:
 - HMAC, specified in [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt][RFC 2104]]
 - CMAC, specified in [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4493.txt][RFC 4493]] and NIST document 800-38B
 - GMAC, specified in NIST document 800-38D
 - Blake2 and Blake2s MAC
 - Poly1305
 - SipHash
 - Skein MAC


#+NAME: make-mac
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-mac mac-name key &rest args) => mac
#+END_SRC

Return a MAC object initialized with a secret /key/. /mac-name/ is
a keyword naming the algorithm you wish /mac/ to use. The supported
MACs can be found by calling [[list-all-macs][list-all-macs]]. They are:
 - blake2-mac
 - blake2s-mac
 - cmac
 - gmac
 - hmac
 - poly1305
 - siphash
 - skein-mac

Like for [[make-digest][make-digest]], /mac-name/ should be a symbol in the ~keyword~
or ~ironclad~ packages.

Some MACs take extra arguments that can be specified in /args/.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(make-mac :blake2-mac key &key digest-length)
(make-mac :blake2s-mac key &key digest-length)
(make-mac :cmac key cipher-name)
(make-mac :gmac key cipher-name initialization-vector)
(make-mac :hmac key digest-name)
(make-mac :poly1305 key)
(make-mac :siphash key &key compression-rounds finalization-rounds digest-length)
(make-mac :skein-mac key &key block-length digest-length)
#+END_EXAMPLE

When making a Blake2 MAC, the length of the /key/ passed to [[make-mac][make-mac]]
must be 64 bytes.

When making a Blake2s MAC, the length of the /key/ passed to [[make-mac][make-mac]]
must be 32 bytes.

When making a CMAC, /cipher-name/ must have a [[block-length][block-length]] of either 8, 16, 32,
64 or 128; this restriction is satisfied by many ciphers in Ironclad with the
notable exception of stream ciphers. /key/ must be an acceptable key for
/cipher-name/.

When making a GMAC, /cipher-name/ must have a [[block-length][block-length]] of 16. /key/ must be
an acceptable key for /cipher-name/. The length of /initialization-vector/ must
be 12 bytes.

When making a Poly1305 MAC, the length of the /key/ passed to [[make-mac][make-mac]] must be
32 bytes.

When making a SipHash MAC, the length of the /key/ passed to [[make-mac][make-mac]] must be 16
bytes. /digest-length/ is 8 by default, but it can also be set to 16. By
default, /compression-rounds/ is 2 and /finalization-rounds/ is 4.

When making a Skein MAC, /block-length/ can be 32 (to use the Skein256
hash function internally), 64 (to use Skein512) or 128 (to use
Skein1024). /digest-length/ can be any length you want the computed
digest to be. By default, /block-length/ is 64 and /digest-length/
is 64.


MAC objects support ~reinitialize-instance~:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(reinitialize-instance mac &rest initargs &key key &allow-other-keys) => mac
#+END_SRC

The /:key/ argument is the secret key, as provided to [[make-mac][make-mac]].


#+NAME: update-mac
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(update-mac mac thing &key &allow-other-keys) => (values)
#+END_SRC

Updates the internal state of /mac/ with the contents of /thing/.
The exact method is determined by the type of /thing/.

There are several methods defined on this generic function that take
a particular MAC and a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~ as
well as the usual /start/ and /end/ keyword arguments. These methods
update the state of /mac/ with the subsequence of the array
denoted by /start/ and /end/. They are not listed here because there's
one method for every type of MAC that Ironclad provides, and
listing them would get very tedious for no benefit. An example should
suffice.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(let* ((key (random-data 32))
       (mac (ironclad:make-mac :hmac key :sha256))
       (array (make-array 16 :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8) :initial-element 0)))
  ;; Update with 16 zeroes.
  (ironclad:update-mac mac array)
  ;; Update with 8 ones.
  (fill array 1 :start 2 :end 10)
  (ironclad:update-mac mac array :start 2 :end 10))
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+NAME: produce-mac
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(produce-mac mac &key digest digest-start) => digest
#+END_SRC

Return the digest of the data processed by /mac/ so far. The internal
state of /mac/ is not modified; this feature makes it possible to
compute a "rolling MAC" of a document.

If /digest/ is provided, the computed digest will be placed into
/digest/ starting at /digest-start/. /digest/ must be a
~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~. An [[insufficient-buffer-space][insufficient-buffer-space]]
error will be signaled if there is insufficient space in /digest/.

The length of the digest returned by [[produce-mac][produce-mac]] is determined by the
kind of MAC and the extra arguments passed to [[make-mac][make-mac]]:
 - blake2-mac: from 1 to 64 bytes (64 by default)
 - blake2s-mac: from 1 to 32 bytes (32 by default)
 - cmac: [[block-length][block-length]] of the /cipher-name/ passed to [[make-mac][make-mac]]
 - gmac: 16 bytes
 - hmac: [[digest-length][digest-length]] of the /digest-name/ passed to [[make-mac][make-mac]]
 - poly1305: 16 bytes
 - siphash: /digest-length/ passed to [[make-mac][make-mac]] (8 by default)
 - skein-mac: /digest-length/ passed to [[make-mac][make-mac]] (64 by default)

** Inquiry functions

#+NAME: list-all-macs
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(list-all-macs) => list
#+END_SRC

Returns a list whose elements may be validly passed to [[make-mac][make-mac]].


#+NAME: mac-supported-p
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(mac-supported-p name) => boolean
#+END_SRC

Returns ~t~ if /name/ would be in the list returned by [[list-all-macs][list-all-macs]],
~nil~ otherwise.

* Authenticated encryption
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: authenticated-encryption
  :END:

#+NAME: make-authenticated-encryption-mode
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-authenticated-encryption-mode name &rest args) => mode
#+END_SRC

Return an authenticated encryption object suitable for use for both encryption
and decryption.

/name/ denotes the mode to use. [[list-all-authenticated-encryption-modes][list-all-authenticated-encryption-modes]] will
tell you the names of all the supported modes. They are:
 - eax (Encrypt then authenticate then translate)
 - etm (Encrypt then MAC)
 - gcm (Galois counter mode)

/name/ can be a symbol in the ~keyword~  or ~ironclad~ packages.

/args/ depends on the chosen authenticated encryption mode.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(make-authenticated-encryption-mode :eax &key tag cipher-name key initialization-vector)
(make-authenticated-encryption-mode :etm &key tag cipher mac)
(make-authenticated-encryption-mode :gcm &key tag cipher-name key initialization-vector)
#+END_EXAMPLE

If /tag/ is specified, it will be used at the end of decryption (when the
/handle-final-block/ flag is ~t~) to check the authenticity of the data.
A ~bad-authentication-tag~ error will be signaled if the data is not authentic.
If you don't specify it, you will have to call [[produce-tag][produce-tag]] after decryption and
check that the tags match (e.g. using [[constant-time-equal][constant-time-equal]]).

When using EAX, /key/ must be a suitable key for the chosen /cipher-name/.

When using ETM, /cipher/ must be a cipher object created by [[make-cipher][make-cipher]].
/mac/ must be a mac object created by [[make-mac][make-mac]].

When using GCM, /cipher-name/ must have a [[block-length][block-length]] of 16 bytes. /key/ must be a suitable key
for the chosen cipher. The length of /initialization-vector/ must be 12 bytes.


#+NAME: process-associated-data
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(process-associated-data mode data &key start end) => (values)
#+END_SRC

Update the internal state of /mode/ with the contents of /data/ between /start/
and /end/ so that they are taken into consideration in the authentication tag.


An authenticated encryption object can be used with the [[encrypt][encrypt]], [[decrypt][decrypt]],
[[encrypt-message][encrypt-message]] and [[decrypt-message][decrypt-message]] functions.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(encrypt mode plaintext ciphertext &key plaintext-start plaintext-end ciphertext-start handle-final-block)
(decrypt mode ciphertext plaintext &key ciphertext-start ciphertext-end plaintext-start handle-final-block)
(encrypt-message mode message &key start end associated-data associated-data-start associated-data-end)
(decrypt-message mode message &key start end associated-data associated-data-start associated-data-end)
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+NAME: produce-tag
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(produce-tag mode &key tag tag-start) => tag
#+END_SRC

Return the authentication tag of the data processed by /mode/ so far. If /tag/
is provided, the computed tag will be placed into /tag/ starting at /tag-start/.
/tag/ must be a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~. An
[[insufficient-buffer-space][insufficient-buffer-space]] error will be signaled if there is insufficient space
in /tag/.

** Inquiry functions

#+NAME: list-all-authenticated-encryption-modes
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(list-all-authenticated-encryption-modes) => list
#+END_SRC

Returns a list whose elements may be validly passed to
[[make-authenticated-encryption-mode][make-authenticated-encryption-mode]].


#+NAME: authenticated-encryption-mode-supported-p
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(authenticated-encryption-mode-supported-p name) => boolean
#+END_SRC

Returns ~t~ if /name/ would be in the list returned by
[[list-all-authenticated-encryption-modes][list-all-authenticated-encryption-modes]] ~nil~ otherwise.

* Key derivation functions
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: key-derivation-functions
  :END:

Ironclad comes with a few key derivation functions:
 - Argon2 (only Argon2d and Argon2i without parallelism are implemented)
 - PBKDF1
 - PBKDF2
 - Scrypt
 - HMAC


#+NAME: derive-key
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(derive-key kdf passphrase salt iteration-count key-length) => digest
#+END_SRC

Given a key derivation function object (produced by [[make-kdf][make-kdf]]),
a password and salt (both must be of type
~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~), and number of iterations,
returns the password digest as a byte array of length /key-length/.

Scrypt and HMAC ignore the /iteration-count/ parameter.


#+NAME: make-kdf
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-kdf kind &key digest n r p block-count additional-key additional-data) => kdf
#+END_SRC

Returns a key derivation function instance.

/kind/ denotes the key derivation function to use. They are:
 - argon2d
 - argon2i
 - pbkdf1
 - pbkdf2
 - scrypt-kdf
 - hmac-kdf

/kind/ can be a symbol in the ~keyword~  or ~ironclad~ packages.

The Argon2 key derivations use the /block-count/, /additional-key/
and /additional-data/ parameters (/block-count/ is the number of 1 KiB
memory blocks used by the function and it must be at least 8,
/additional-key/ and /additional-data/ are optional).
The PBKDF algorithms use /digest/.
The Scrypt key derivation uses cost parameters /N/, /r/ and /p/ (/N/
is a CPU cost parameter that must be a power of 2, /r/ and /p/ are
memory cost parameters that must be defined such that
/r/ * /p/ <= 2^30).

The default Scrypt parameters are /N/ = 4096, /r/ = 8, and /p/ = 2.
Please note that depending on the values of /N/ and /r/,
[[derive-key][derive-key]] may not be able to allocate sufficient space for its
temporary arrays.

The HMAC-KDF algorithm uses the /digest/ parameter to precise what
hash function is used. It also optionally uses the /additional-data/
to precise the ~info~ vector from the [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869][RFC]].

** PBKDF convenience functions

Ironclad comes with convenience functions for using PBKDF1 and PBKDF2
to store passwords.


#+NAME: pbkdf2-hash-password
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(pbkdf2-hash-password password &key salt digest iterations) => password
#+END_SRC

Convenience function for hashing passwords using the PBKDF2 algorithm.
Returns the derived hash of the password, and the original salt, as
byte vectors.


#+NAME: pbkdf2-hash-password-to-combined-string
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(pbkdf2-hash-password-to-combined-string password &key salt digest iterations) => password
#+END_SRC

Convenience function for hashing passwords using the PBKDF2 algorithm.
Returns the derived hash of the password as a single string that
encodes the given salt and PBKDF2 algorithm parameters.


#+NAME: pbkdf2-check-password
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(pbkdf2-check-password password combined-salt-and-digest) => boolean
#+END_SRC

Given a /password/ byte vector and a combined salt and digest string
produced by [[pbkdf2-hash-password-to-combined-string][pbkdf2-hash-password-to-combined-string]], checks whether
the password is valid.

* Public key cryptography
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: public-key-cryptography
  :END:

Ironclad includes support for a few public key cryptography algorithms.

Encryption algorithms:
 - Elgamal
 - RSA

Signature algorithms:
 - DSA
 - Ed25519
 - Ed448
 - Elgamal
 - RSA

Diffie-Hellman key exchange:
 - Curve25519
 - Curve448
 - Elgamal

** Key pair generation

#+NAME: generate-key-pair
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(generate-key-pair kind &key num-bits &allow-other-keys) => private-key, public-key
#+END_SRC

Return a key pair according to /kind/. The generation of DSA, Elgamal
and RSA key pairs can take some time. If /kind/ is ~:dsa~ or ~:rsa~,
the /num-bits/ key argument indicating the size of the keys to
generate must be specified. If /kind/ is ~:elgamal~, /num-bits/ must
be specified unless /compatible-with-key/ is specified, in which case
the group parameters are taken from the specified key instead of being
generated.

For example, if Alice wants to generate a key pair for
a Diffie-Hellman exchange with Bob's Elgamal key pair:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(generate-key-pair :elgamal :compatible-with-key bob-public-key)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Key construction

#+NAME: make-public-key
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-public-key kind &key &allow-other-keys) => public-key
#+END_SRC

Return a public key according to /kind/. The /&key/
arguments vary according to /kind/. The interesting bits are in the
methods that specialize on /kind/, below.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(make-public-key :curve25519 &key y) => public-key
(make-public-key :curve448 &key y) => public-key
(make-public-key :dsa &key p q g y) => public-key
(make-public-key :ed25519 &key y) => public-key
(make-public-key :ed448 &key y) => public-key
(make-public-key :elgamal &key p g y) => public-key
(make-public-key :rsa &key e n) => public-key
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+NAME: make-private-key
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-private-key kind &key &allow-other-keys) => private-key
#+END_SRC

Return a private key according to /kind/. The /&key/ arguments vary
according to /kind/. The interesting bits are in the methods that
specialize on /kind/, below.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(make-private-key :curve25519 &key x y) => private-key
(make-private-key :curve448 &key x y) => private-key
(make-private-key :dsa &key p q g y x) => private-key
(make-private-key :ed25519 &key x y) => private-key
(make-private-key :ed448 &key x y) => private-key
(make-private-key :elgamal &key p g y x) => private-key
(make-private-key :rsa &key d n) => private-key
#+END_EXAMPLE


For Curve25519, Curve448, Ed25519 and Ed448 keys, the type of the
parameters is ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~:
 - /x/, the secret key
 - /y/, the public key

For DSA and Elgamal keys, the type of the parameters is ~integer~:
 - /p/, the prime number defining the DL group
 - /q/, the prime number defining the DL sub-group
 - /g/, the generator
 - /y/, the public key
 - /x/, the private key

For RSA keys, the type of the parameters is ~integer~:
 - /n/, the modulus
 - /e/, the public key
 - /d/, the private key

*** Key destructuring

The [[destructure-public-key][destructure-public-key]] and [[destructure-private-key][destructure-private-key]] functions can
be useful if you need to store keys somewhere for future use.

#+NAME: destructure-public-key
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(destructure-public-key public-key) => plist
#+END_SRC

Return the elements of a public key in a plist. The indicators of the
plist match the /&key/ arguments of the [[make-public-key][make-public-key]] method.


#+NAME: destructure-private-key
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(destructure-private-key private-key) => plist
#+END_SRC

Return the elements of a private key in a plist. The indicators of the
plist match the /&key/ arguments of the [[make-private-key][make-private-key]] method.

** Digital signatures

#+NAME: sign-message
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(sign-message key message &key start end &allow-other-keys) => signature
#+END_SRC

Return a signature of /message/ between /start/ and /end/ signed with
/key/; the class of /key/ determines the algorithm used to create the
/signature/.

_Note:_ The [[sign-message][sign-message]] does not perform the hashing of the data. You
should hash your data using your favorite hash function, and then use
this hash as the /message/ passed to [[sign-message][sign-message]].


#+NAME: verify-signature
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(verify-signature key message signature &key start end &allow-other-keys) => boolean
#+END_SRC

Verify whether /signature/ is a valid signature of /message/ between
/start/ and /end/ using /key/. Return ~t~ is the signature is valid
and ~nil~ otherwise.

*** Padding

To be secure, RSA signature requires the message to be padded.
The /pss/ key parameter is provided to pad (or unpad) the message
during signature (or verification) with the PSS scheme of PKCS-1.
The value of the /pss/ key parameter can be either a digest name
or ~t~ (which will use the sha1 digest).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(sign-message rsa-private-key message :pss t) => signature
(verify-signature rsa-public-key message signature :pss t) => boolean
#+END_EXAMPLE

The functions /pss-encode/ and /pss-decode/ can also be used by hand if
necessary.

*** Format of signatures

[[sign-message][sign-message]] returns signatures as octet vectors. When the signature
contains several values (e.g. the R and S values of DSA signatures),
the octet vector is the concatenation of these values (e.g. the first
half of the vector is the R value, the second half is the S value).
You can use the [[make-signature][make-signature]] and [[destructure-signature][destructure-signature]] functions if
you need access to the elements of a signature (e.g. to use
a different kind of serialization).


#+NAME: make-signature
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-signature kind &key &allow-other-keys) => signature
#+END_SRC

Return an octet vector representing a signature. The /&key/ arguments
vary according to /kind/. The interesting bits are in the methods that
specialize on /kind/, below.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(make-signature :dsa &key r s n-bits) => signature
(make-signature :ed25519 &key r s) => signature
(make-signature :ed448 &key r s) => signature
(make-signature :elgamal &key r s n-bits) => signature
(make-signature :rsa &key s n-bits) => signature
#+END_EXAMPLE

For Ed25519 and Ed448 signatures, the type of the parameters /r/ and
/s/ is ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~.

For DSA and Elgamal signatures, the type of the parameters /r/, /s/
and /n-bits/ is ~integer~.

For RSA signatures, the type of the parameters /s/ and /n-bits/ is
~integer~.


#+NAME: destructure-signature
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(destructure-signature kind signature) => plist
#+END_SRC

Return the elements of a signature in a plist. The indicators of the
plist match the /&key/ arguments of the [[make-signature][make-signature]] method.

** Encryption and decryption

#+NAME: encrypt-message
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(encrypt-message key message &key start end &allow-other-keys) => encrypted-message
#+END_SRC

Return the /message/ between /start/ and /end/ encrypted with the /key/;
the class of /key/ determines the algorithm used to encrypt the message.


#+NAME: decrypt-message
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(decrypt-message key message &key start end n-bits &allow-other-keys) => decrypted-message
#+END_SRC

Return the /message/ between /start/ and /end/ decrypted by the /key/;
the class of /key/ determines the algorithm used to decrypt the message.
/n-bits/ can be used to indicate the expected size of the decrypted
message (e.g. a small byte vector starting with zeros encrypted
without padding, which is probably a bad idea, c.f. Padding section).

*** Padding

To be secure, RSA encryption requires the message to be padded. The
/oaep/ key parameter is provided to pad (or unpad) the message during
encryption (or decryption) with the OAEP scheme of PKCS-1.
The value of the /oaep/ key parameter can be either a digest name
or ~t~ (which will use the sha1 digest).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(encrypt-message rsa-public-key message :oaep t) => encrypted-message
(decrypt-message rsa-private-key message :oaep t) => decrypted-message
#+END_EXAMPLE

The functions /oaep-encode/ and /oaep-decode/ can also be used by hand if
necessary.

*** Format of messages

[[encrypt-message][encrypt-message]] returns encrypted messages as octet vectors. When the
message contains several values (e.g. the C1 and C2 values of Elgamal
messages), the octet vector is the concatenation of these values (e.g.
the first half of the vector is the big-endian representation of the
C1 value, the second half is the C2 value). You can use the
[[make-message][make-message]] and [[destructure-message][destructure-message]] functions if you need access to
the elements of a message (e.g. to use a different kind of
serialization).


#+NAME: make-message
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-message kind &key &allow-other-keys) => message
#+END_SRC

Return an octet vector representing a message. The /&key/ arguments
vary according to /kind/. The interesting bits are in the methods that
specialize on /kind/, below.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(make-message :elgamal &key c1 c2 n-bits) => message
(make-message :rsa &key m n-bits) => message
#+END_EXAMPLE

For Elgamal messages, the type of the parameters /c1/, /c2/ and
/n-bits/ is ~integer~.

For RSA signatures, the type of the parameters /m/ and /n-bits/ is
~integer~.


#+NAME: destructure-message
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(destructure-message kind message) => plist
#+END_SRC

Return the elements of a message in a plist. The indicators of the
plist match the /&key/ arguments of the [[make-message][make-message]] method.

** Diffie-Hellman key exchange

#+NAME: diffie-hellman
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(diffie-hellman private-key public-key) => bytes
#+END_SRC

Return a secret shared by two users Alice and Bob, computed from
Alice's private key and Bob's public key (these keys must be
compatible, i.e. have the same group parameters).

* Pseudo-random number generation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: pseudo-random-number-generation
  :END:

The =*prng*= special variable indicates which pseudo-random number
generator is used by default by functions that need to generate some
random data. It defaults to a sensible OS-specific value.

The vast, vast vast number of users should just use the default
~os-prng~ (which uses =/dev/urandom= on Unix and ~CryptGenRandom~ on
Windows). For users who need /deterministic/,
high-quality-random-seeming numbers (e.g. for Monte Carlo
simulations), ~fortuna-generator~ is provided. Finally, if you're
running on a platform without a decent PRNG (these are few and far
between now), you may require the full ~fortuna-prng~. When in doubt,
use ~os-prng~, which is the default.


#+NAME:make-prng
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-prng name &key seed) => prng
#+END_SRC

Create a pseudo-random number generator.

/name/ denotes the style of PRNG to use. [[list-all-prngs][list-all-prngs]] will tell you
the names of all supported PRNGs. Currently supported PRNGs are:
 - OS
 - Fortuna
 - Fortuna-generator

/name/ can be a symbol in the ~keyword~ package or in the ~ironclad~
package.

/seed/ is a *seed descriptor*. If ~nil~, the PRNG will not be seeded
(which may prevent it from generating output until it is seeded,
depending on the PRNG in question). If ~:random~ then the PRNG will be
seeded with the OS's cryptographically-secure PRNG. If ~:urandom~ then
the PRNG will be seeded with the OS's fast-but-potentially-less-secure
PRNG, if available (if not, will fallback to ~:random~). If it is
a pathname indicator, a seed will be read from the indicated file,
then a new seed will be generated and written back to the file
(over-writing the old seed). Finally, if it is a byte vector, it will
be used to seed the PRNG.

In single-threaded applications, you should very rarely need to call [[make-prng][make-prng]];
the default OS-provided PRNG should be appropriate in nearly all cases.

In multi-threaded applications, each thread that will use functions requiring
random data must have its own PRNG, or several threads might generate the same
"random" data. If the threads are created using the *bordeaux-threads* library
(or by a library using *bordeaux-threads*, like *lparallel*), this is done
automatically. However, if you are using the threading functions of your Common
Lisp implementation directly, you have to bind the ~*prng*~ special variable to
a new PRNG in each thread. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(make-thread (lambda ()
               (let ((crypto:*prng* (crypto:make-prng :os)))
                 (forms-for-thread-1))))

(make-thread (lambda ()
               (let ((crypto:*prng* (crypto:make-prng :os)))
                 (forms-for-thread-2))))
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+NAME: list-all-prngs
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(list-all-prngs) => list
#+END_SRC

List all known PRNG types.


#+NAME: random-data
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(random-data num-bytes &optional prng) => bytes
#+END_SRC

Generate /num-bytes/ bytes of random data from /prng/. Updates the
state of the generator.


#+NAME: random-bits
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(random-bits num-bits &optional prng) => integer
#+END_SRC

Generate an integer with /num-bits/ bits.


#+NAME: strong-random
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(strong-random limit &optional prng) => number
#+END_SRC

A drop-in replacement for ~common-lisp:random~, [[strong-random][strong-random]]
generates a number (an integer if /limit/ is an integer and a float if
it is a float) between 0 and /limit/ - 1 in an unbiased fashion.


#+NAME: read-os-random-seed
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(read-os-random-seed source &optional prng) => reseed-count
#+END_SRC

Read an OS-provided random seed (from =/dev/urandom= or =/dev/random=
on Unix; ~CryptGenRandom~ on Windows) and reseed /prng/.

/source/ may be ~:random~, which indicates =/dev/random= or
~:urandom~, which indicates =/dev/urandom=. On Windows,
~CryptGenRandom~ is always used.


#+NAME: read-seed
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(read-seed path &optional prng) => t
#+END_SRC

Read enough bytes from /path/ to reseed /prng/, then generate
a pseudo-random seed and write it back to /path/. If /path/ doesn't
exist, calls [[read-os-random-seed][read-os-random-seed]] to get a truly random seed from the
OS. Note that reseeding does *not* reset the generator's state to the
seed value; rather, it *combines* the generator's state with the seed
to form a new state.


#+NAME: write-seed
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(write-seed path &optional prng) => t
#+END_SRC

Generate enough random data to reseed /prng/, then write it to /path/.

** Example

** Fortuna

You should only use the Fortuna PRNG if your OS does not provided
a sufficiently-good PRNG. If you use a Unix or Unix-like OS (e.g.
Linux), macOS or Windows, it does. Only use the Fortuna PRNG if you
know for certain that you need it.

Fortuna is a cryptographically-secure random number presented by
Ferguson, Schneier and Kohno in /Cryptography Engineering/. It is
built around 32 entropy pools, which are used with decreasing
frequency for each reseed (e.g. pool 0 is used in each reseed, pool
1 in every other reseed, pool 2 in every fourth reseed and so forth).
Pools are seeded with data from up to 256 sources.

Each application should have one or more entropy sources (say, one for
each OS random number source, one for the low bits of the current
time, one for the output of a particular command or group of commands
and so forth). A source should be used to add randomness to each pool
in order, so source 0 should top up pool 0, then pool 1, and so forth
up to pool 31, then loop back to pool 1 again. Be very careful to
spread entropy across all 32 pools.

Fortuna automatically feeds entropy from the pools back into its
random state when [[random-data][random-data]] is called, using a method designed to
make it resistant to various avenues of attack; even in case of
generator compromise it will return to a safe state within a bounded
time.

For purposes of reseeding, Fortuna will not reseed until the first
pool contains 128 bits of entropy; ~+min-pool-size+~ sets the number
of bytes this is; it defaults to a very conservative 128, meaning that
by default each byte of event is assumed to contain a single bit of
randomness.

It also will not reseed more than ten times per second.


#+NAME: add-random-event
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-random-event source pool-id event &optional prng) => pool-length
#+END_SRC

Add entropy to /prng/.

/source/ is an integer in the range 0-255 specifiying the event's
application-defined source.

/pool-id/ is an integer in the range 0-31 specifying the pool to top
up.

/event/ is up to 32 bytes of data (for longer events, hash them down
or break them up into chunks).

* Gray streams
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: gray-streams
  :END:

Ironclad includes support for several convenient stream abstractions
based on Gray streams. Gray streams support in Ironclad is included
for SBCL, CMUCL, OpenMCL/CCL, Lispworks, ABCL, ECL, Clisp and Allegro.

** Octet streams

Octet streams are very similar to Common Lisp's ~string-stream~ except
they deal in octets instead of characters.


#+NAME: make-octet-input-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-octet-input-stream buffer &optional start end) => octet-input-stream
#+END_SRC

As ~make-string-input-stream~, only with octets instead of characters.


#+NAME: make-octet-output-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-octet-output-stream) => octet-output-stream
#+END_SRC

As ~make-string-output-stream~, only with octets instead of characters.


#+NAME: get-output-stream-octets
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(get-output-stream-octets stream) => octet-vector
#+END_SRC

As ~get-output-stream-string~, only with an octet output-steam instead
of a string output-stream.


#+NAME: with-octet-input-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-octet-input-stream ((var buffer &optional (start 0) end) &body body))
#+END_SRC

Within /body/, /var/ is bound to an octet input stream. Reading from
/var/ gives the bytes between the indexes /start/ and /end/ of
/buffer/. The result of the last form of /body/ is returned.


#+NAME: with-octet-output-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-octet-output-stream ((var) &body body)) => bytes
#+END_SRC

Within /body/, /var/ is bound to an octet output stream. After all the
forms in /body/ have been executed, the data that has been written to
/var/ (and that hasn't been consumed by a call to
[[get-output-stream-octets][get-output-stream-octets]] within /body/) is returned.

** Digest streams

Digest streams compute a digest of the data written to them according
to a specific digest algorithm.

Example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(defun frobbing-function (stream)
  ;; We want to compute a digest of the data being written to STREAM
  ;; without involving our callees in the process.
  (let* ((digesting-stream (crypto:make-digesting-stream :sha1))
         (stream (make-broadcast-stream stream digesting-stream)))
    ;; Feed data to STREAM.
    (frob-guts stream)
    ;; Do something with the digest computed.
    (... (crypto:produce-digest digesting-stream) ...)
    ...))
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+NAME: make-digesting-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-digesting-stream digest &rest args) => stream
#+END_SRC

Make a stream that computes a digest of the data written to it
according to the algorithm /digest/. The parameters that can be used
by some algorithms can be specified as /args/.
[[produce-digest][produce-digest]] may be used to obtain a digest of all the data written
to the stream.

_Note:_ Calling [[produce-digest][produce-digest]] on a digest stream does not alter
the internal state of the digest.


#+NAME: with-digesting-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-digesting-stream (var digest-name &rest args) &body body) => digest
#+END_SRC

Within /body/, /var/ is bound to a digesting stream for the
/digest-name/ algorithm. After all the forms in /body/ have been
executed, the digest of the data that has been written to /var/ is
returned.

** Cipher streams

Cipher streams encrypt or decrypt the data written to or read from
them according to a specific cipher algorithm.


#+NAME: make-encrypting-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-encrypting-stream stream cipher mode key &key initialization-vector direction) => stream
#+END_SRC

Make a stream wrapped around the binary stream /stream/ that encrypts
data according to the algorithm /cipher/ initialized with a /mode/,
a /key/ and an /initialization-vector/.
If /direction/ is ~:input~, the data read from the created input
stream is the encryption of the data coming from /stream/.
If /direction/ is ~:output~, the data written to the created output
stream is encrypted before being sent to /stream/.


#+NAME: make-decrypting-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-decrypting-stream stream cipher mode key &key initialization-vector direction) => stream
#+END_SRC

Make a stream wrapped around the binary stream /stream/ that decrypts
data according to the algorithm /cipher/ initialized with a /mode/,
a /key/ and an /initialization-vector/.
If /direction/ is ~:input~, the data read from the created input
stream is the decryption of the data coming from /stream/.
If /direction/ is ~:output~, the data written to the created output
stream is decrypted before being sent to /stream/.


_Note:_ Only stream ciphers and block ciphers in CTR, CFB, CFB8 or OFB mode are
supported by [[make-encrypting-stream][make-encrypting-stream]] and [[make-decrypting-stream][make-decrypting-stream]].


#+NAME: with-encrypting-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-encrypting-stream ((var stream cipher mode key &key initialization-vector direction) &body body))
#+END_SRC

Within /body/, /var/ is bound to an encrypting stream. The result of
the last form of /body/ is returned.


#+NAME: with-decrypting-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-decrypting-stream ((var stream cipher mode key &key initialization-vector direction) &body body))
#+END_SRC

Within /body/, /var/ is bound to a decrypting stream. The result of
the last form of /body/ is returned.

** MAC streams

MAC streams compute a message authentication code of the data written
to them according to a specific MAC algorithm.

#+NAME: make-authenticating-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(make-authenticating-stream mac key &rest args) => stream
#+END_SRC

Make a stream that computes a MAC of the data written to it according
to the algorithm /mac/ initialized with a /key/. The parameters used
to create the MAC can be specified as /args/.
[[produce-mac][produce-mac]] may be used to obtain a MAC of all the data written to the
stream.

_Note:_ Calling [[produce-mac][produce-mac]] on a MAC stream does not alter the
internal state of the MAC.


Example: encrypt some data and compute a MAC of the ciphertext
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(let* ((data ...)
       (output-stream ...)
       (encryption-key ...)
       (authentication-key ...)
       (iv ...)
       (mac-stream (make-authenticating-stream :hmac
                                               authentication-key
                                               :sha3))
       (stream (make-broadcast-stream output-stream mac-stream))
       (cipher-stream (make-encrypting-stream stream
                                              :chacha
                                              :stream
                                              encryption-key
                                              :initialization-vector iv)))
  (write-sequence data cipher-stream)
  ...
  (let ((mac (produce-mac mac-stream)))
    ...))
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+NAME: with-authenticating-stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-authenticating-stream (var mac-name key &rest args) &body body) => mac
#+END_SRC

Within /body/, /var/ is bound to an authenticating stream for the
/mac-name/ algorithm. After all the forms in /body/ have been
executed, the message authentication code of the data that has been
written to /var/ is returned.

* Utility functions
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: utility-functions
  :END:

#+NAME: ub-ref-le
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(ub16ref/le vector index) => value
(ub32ref/le vector index) => value
(ub64ref/le vector index) => value
#+END_SRC

This family of functions accesses an unsigned 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit
value stored in little-endian order starting at /index/ in /vector/.
/vector/ must be a ~(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))~. These
functions are SETFable.


#+NAME: ub-ref-be
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(ub16ref/be vector index) => value
(ub32ref/be vector index) => value
(ub64ref/be vector index) => value
#+END_SRC

As the above, only the value is stored in big-endian order.


#+NAME: array-hex-string
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(byte-array-to-hex-string vector &key start end element-type) => string
(hex-string-to-byte-array string &key start end) => string
(ascii-string-to-byte-array string &key start end) => vector
#+END_SRC

[[array-hex-string][byte-array-to-hex-string]] converts the bytes of /vector/ between
/start/ and /end/ into a hexadecimal string. It is useful for
converting digests to a more readable form. /element-type/ indicates
the element-type of the returned string.

[[array-hex-string][hex-string-to-byte-array]] parses a substring of /string/ delimited
/start/ and /end/ of hexadecimal digits into a byte array.

[[array-hex-string][ascii-string-to-byte-array]] is provided as a quick and dirty way to
convert a string to a byte array suitable for feeding to [[update-digest][update-digest]]
or [[encrypt][encrypt]]. Care should be taken to ensure that the provided string is
actually an ASCII string. /start/ and /end/ have their usual
interpretations.


#+NAME: octets-integer
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(octets-to-integer octet-vec &key start end big-endian n-bits) => number
(integer-to-octets bignum &key n-bits big-endian) => vector
#+END_SRC

[[octets-integer][octets-to-integer]] converts the bytes of /octet-vec/ between /start/
and /end/ to an integer as though the bytes denoted a number in
base 256. /big-endian/ is a boolean indicating whether the bytes are
to be read in big-endian or little-endian order. /n-bits/ specifies
how many bits should be considered as significant in the resulting
number.

[[octets-integer][integer-to-octets]] is the reverse operation.


#+NAME: expt-mod
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(expt-mod n exponent modulus) => number
(expt-mod/unsafe n exponent modulus) => number
#+END_SRC

Raises /n/ to the /exponent/ power modulo /modulus/ in a more
efficient fashion than ~(mod (expt n exponent) modulus)~.
[[expt-mod][expt-mod]] is using the Montgomery ladder algorithm to be more robust
against timing attacks.
[[expt-mod][expt-mod/unsafe]] runs faster than [[expt-mod][expt-mod]] but is not safe against
timing attacks; don't use it on secret data.


#+NAME: make-random-salt
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
make-random-salt &optional size => bytes
#+END_SRC

Generate a byte vector of /size/ (default 16) random bytes, suitable
for use as a password salt.


#+NAME: constant-time-equal
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
constant-time-equal data1 data2 => boolean
#+END_SRC

Check whether the contents of the byte arrays /data1/ and /data2/ are
the same. This function runs in constant time (for a given array
length) to prevent timing attacks. It can be used to compare passwords
or MACs.
